about: Suggest an idea for this project

Input your idea here. PLEASE avoid asking for features that are part of any of our upstreams (Bubber, TG), as those will be added automatically whenever we update from them. However, asking for those mechanics to be adjusted/changed to fit our server better is fine.

Also, if your suggestion is complex, sizeable in scope, or you are still in the process of fleshing it out, consider posting it in the #suggestions channel of our discord server, as it will help you get more people to contribute ideas to it.
