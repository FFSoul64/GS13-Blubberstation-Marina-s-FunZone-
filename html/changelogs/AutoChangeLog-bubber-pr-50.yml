changes:
  - rscadd: "ports fat and perma fat damage"
  - rscadd: "Adds calorite glass"
  - rscadd: "Adds calorite windows. Any laser projectile passing through them will gain some fattening power, regardless of whether it had any initially or not."
  - rscadd: "Adds calorite reflectors. Those are single side reflectors that add fattening power to projectiles that bounce off of them"
  - rscadd: "adds calorite glass shard. It deals fattening damage type"
  - rscadd: "picking up calorite and calorite glass without gloves will cause a small amount of weight gain."
  - code_imp: "makes all projectiles have the `fat_to_add` variable, set to 0 by default. This allows literally every projectile to be capable of fattening someone on top of doing normal damage"
  - code_imp: "adds a new fattening component. Adding it onto an object causes that object to fatten a person interacting with it depending on the flags. Right now supports touching with bare hand, touching with items and bumping into"
