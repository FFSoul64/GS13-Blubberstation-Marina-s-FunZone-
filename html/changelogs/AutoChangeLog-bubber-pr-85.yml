changes:
  - rscadd: "adds micro calorite poisoning. It is a persistent debuff applied onto the character upon consuming the micro calorite reagent. It has various effects based on it's value, in a range from 0 to 100. It's effects include increasing weight gain and decreasing weight loss rate, random stomach gurgles, increasing hunger, removal of the fat aversion trait, mood debuffs when a character is below a certain fullness level, addition of the fat affinity trait, a movespeed debuff, and passive gaining of real and perma fat. It's value increases and decreases very slowly, likely requiring multiple rounds to take full effect. Current gain rate is 10 points per hour, assuming micro calorite is inside a character for the entire hour."
  - rscadd: "allows the health analyzer to report on calorite poisoning in the subject. The advanced one will give slightly more detailed information"
  - rscadd: "adds a severe fatness penalty pref, for more extreme effects of fattening items"
  - rscadd: "micro calorite will now slowly increase the value of micro calorite poisoning"
  - rscadd: "fatoray shots will now reduce the value of micro calorite poisoning in exchange for adding a significant amount of perma fat onto the subject"
  - balance: "speeds up the rate at which lipoifium is formed"
  - bugfix: "fixes a typo with the health analyzer BFI readout"
